  description: |
    Requests that the beacon node produce a sync committee contribution.

    A 503 error must be returned if the block identified by the response
    `beacon_block_root` is optimistic (i.e. the sync committee contribution
    refers to a block that has not been fully verified by an execution engine).

    A 404 error must be returned if no sync committee contribution is available
    for the requested `beacon_block_root`.
