  summary: Detemine if a distributed validator has been selected to make a sync committee contribution
  description: |
    Submit sync committee selections to a DVT middleware client.
    It returns the threshold aggregated sync committee selection.
    This endpoint should be used by a validator client running as 
    part of a distributed validator cluster, and is implemented 
    by a distributed validator middleware client. This endpoint is 
    used to exchange partial selection proof slot signatures for 
    combined/aggregated selection proofs to allow a validator client 
    to correctly determine if one of its validators has been selected 
    to perform a sync committee contribution (sync aggregation) duty in this slot.
