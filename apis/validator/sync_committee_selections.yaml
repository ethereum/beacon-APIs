  summary: Determine if a distributed validator has been selected to make a sync committee contribution
  description: |
    Submit sync committee selections to a DVT middleware client. It returns the threshold aggregated sync 
    committee selection. This endpoint should be used by a validator client running as part of a distributed 
    validator cluster, and is implemented by a distributed validator middleware client. This endpoint is 
    used to exchange partial selection proofs (slot signatures) for combined/aggregated selection proofs to 
    allow a validator client to correctly determine if any of its validators has been selected to perform a 
    sync committee contribution (sync aggregation) duty in a slot. Validator clients running in a distributed validator cluster must query this endpoint
    at the start of each slot for all validators that are included in the current sync committee. Consensus
    clients need not support this endpoint and may return a 501.
