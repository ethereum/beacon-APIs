  summary: Determine if a distributed validator has been selected to aggregate attestations
  description: |
    This endpoint should be used by a validator client running as part of a distributed validator cluster, and is 
    implemented by a distributed validator middleware client. This endpoint is used to exchange partial 
    selection proofs for combined/aggregated selection proofs to allow a validator client 
    to correctly determine if one of its validators has been selected to perform an aggregation duty in a slot. 
    Validator clients must query this endpoint at the start of an epoch for all validators that have attester duties 
    in that epoch. Consensus clients need not support this endpoint and may return a 501.
