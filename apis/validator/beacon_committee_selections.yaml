  summary: Determine if a distributed validator has been selected to aggregate
  description: |
    This endpoint should be used by a validator client running as 
    part of a distributed validator cluster, and is implemented 
    by a distributed validator middleware client. This endpoint is 
    used to exchange partial selection proof slot signatures for 
    combined/aggregated selection proofs to allow a validator client 
    to correctly determine if one of its validators has been selected 
    to perform an aggregation duty in this slot.
