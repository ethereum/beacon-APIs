  summary: "Indicates if a validator has been observed on the network"
  operationId: "getLiveness"
  description: "Requests the beacon node to indicate if a validator has been
    observed to be live a given epoch. The beacon node might detect liveness by
    observing messages from the validator on the network, in the beacon chain,
    from its API or from any other source. It is important to note that the
    values returned by the beacon node are not canonical; they are best-effort
    and based upon a subjective view of the network"
