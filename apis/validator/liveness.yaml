  summary: "Indicates if a validator has been observed on the network"
  operationId: "getLiveness"
  description: "Requests the beacon node to indicate if a validator has been
    observed to be live in a given epoch. The beacon node might detect liveness by
    observing messages from the validator on the network, in the beacon chain,
    from its API or from any other source. A beacon node SHOULD support the current
    and previous epoch, however it MAY support earlier epoch. It is important to
    note that the values returned by the beacon node are not canonical; they are best-effort
    and based upon a subjective view of the network. A beacon node that was recently
    started or suffered a network partition may indicate that a validator is not live
    when it actually is."
