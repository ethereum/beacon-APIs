  summary: "Produce a new blinded block, without signature."
  deprecated: true
  description: |
    Requests a beacon node to produce a valid blinded block, which can then be signed by a validator. 
    A blinded block is a block with only a transactions root, rather than a full transactions list.

    Metadata in the response indicates the type of block produced, and the supported types of block
    will be added to as forks progress.
    
    Before Bellatrix, this endpoint will return a `BeaconBlock`.

        is a flag and does not take a value.
