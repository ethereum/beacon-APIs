  summary: "Produce an attestation data"
  description: |
    Requests that the beacon node produce an AttestationData. For `slot`s in
    Electra and later, this AttestationData must have a `committee_index` of 0.

    A 503 error must be returned if the block identified by the response
    `beacon_block_root` is optimistic (i.e. the attestation attests to a block
    that has not been fully verified by an execution engine).
