  summary: "Get attester duties"
  operationId: "getAttesterDuties"
  description: "Requests the beacon node to provide a set of attestation duties,
    which should be performed by validators, for a particular epoch.

    Duties should only need to be checked once per epoch,
    however a chain reorganization (of > MIN_SEED_LOOKAHEAD epochs) could occur,
    resulting in a change of duties. For full safety, you should monitor head events and confirm the
    dependent root in this response matches:

      - event.previous_duty_dependent_root when `compute_epoch_at_slot(event.slot) == epoch`

      - event.current_duty_dependent_root when `compute_epoch_at_slot(event.slot) + 1 == epoch`

      - event.block otherwise


    The dependent_root value is `get_block_root_at_slot(state, compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch - 1) - 1)`
    or the genesis block root in the case of underflow."
