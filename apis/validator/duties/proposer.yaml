  summary: "Get block proposers duties"
  operationId: "getProposerDuties"
  description: "Request beacon node to provide all validators that are scheduled to propose a block in the given epoch.

    Duties should only need to be checked once per epoch,
    however a chain reorganization could occur that results in a change of duties. For full safety,
    you should monitor head events and confirm the dependent root in this response matches:

     - event.current_duty_dependent_root when `compute_epoch_at_slot(event.slot) == epoch`

     - event.block otherwise


    The dependent_root value is `get_block_root_at_slot(state, compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch) - 1)`
    or the genesis block root in the case of underflow."
  parameters:
    - name: epoch
      in: path
      required: true
