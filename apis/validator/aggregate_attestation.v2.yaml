  summary: "Get aggregated attestation"
  description: |
    Aggregates all attestations matching given attestation data root, slot and committee index.

    A 503 error must be returned if the block identified by the response
    `beacon_block_root` is optimistic (i.e. the aggregated attestation attests
    to a block that has not been fully verified by an execution engine).

    A 404 error must be returned if no attestation is available for the requested
    `attestation_data_root`.
