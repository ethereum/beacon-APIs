  summary: "Publish a signed block."
  operationId: "publishBlindedBlockV2"
  description: |
    Instructs the beacon node to use the components of the `SignedBlindedBeaconBlock` to construct and publish a 
    `SignedBeaconBlock` by swapping out the `transactions_root` for the corresponding full list of `transactions`.
    The beacon node should broadcast a newly constructed `SignedBeaconBlock` to the beacon network,
    to be included in the beacon chain. The beacon node is not required to validate the signed
    `BeaconBlock`, and a successful response (20X) only indicates that the broadcast has been
    successful. The beacon node is expected to integrate the new block into its state, and
    therefore validate the block internally, however blocks which fail the validation are still
    broadcast but a different status code is returned (202). Before Bellatrix, this endpoint will accept 
    a `SignedBeaconBlock`. The broadcast behaviour may be adjusted via the `broadcast_validation`
    query parameter.

    - name: broadcast_validation
      in: query
      required: false

        Level of validation that must be applied to a block before it is broadcast.

        Possible values:
        - **`gossip`** (default): lightweight gossip checks only
        - **`consensus`**: full consensus checks, including validation of all signatures and
          blocks fields _except_ for the execution payload transactions.
        - **`consensus_and_equivocation`**: the same as `consensus`, with an extra equivocation
          check immediately before the block is broadcast. If the block is found to be an
          equivocation it fails validation.

        If the block fails the requested level of a validation a 400 status MUST be returned
        immediately and the block MUST NOT be broadcast to the network.

        If validation succeeds, the block must still be fully verified before it is
        incorporated into the state and a 20x status is returned to the caller.
