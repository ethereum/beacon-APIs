  summary: "Publish a signed block."
  operationId: "publishBlock"
  description: |
    Instructs the beacon node to broadcast a newly signed beacon block to the beacon network,
    to be included in the beacon chain. A success response (20x) indicates that the block
    passed gossip validation and was successfully broadcast onto the network.
    The beacon node is also expected to integrate the block into state, but may broadcast it
    before doing so, so as to aid timely delivery of the block. Should the block fail full
    validation, a separate success response code (202) is used to indicate that the block was
    successfully broadcast but failed integration. After Deneb, this additionally instructs
    the beacon node to broadcast all given blobs.
