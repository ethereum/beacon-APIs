  description: |
    Returns filterable list of validators with their balance, status and index.

    Information will be returned for all indices or public key that match known validators.  If an index or public key does not
    match any known validator, no information will be returned but this will not cause an error.  There are no guarantees for the
    returned data in terms of ordering; both the index and public key are returned for each validator, and can be used to confirm
    for which inputs a response has been returned.

    The POST variant of this endpoint has the same semantics as the GET endpoint but passes
    the lists of IDs and statuses via a POST body in order to enable larger requests.
