  summary: "Get validators from state"
  description: |
    Returns filterable list of validators with their index.

    Information will be returned for all indices or public keys that match known validators.  If an index or public key does not
    match any known validator, no information will be returned but this will not cause an error.  There are no guarantees for the
    returned data in terms of ordering; both the index and public key are returned for each validator, and can be used to confirm
    for which inputs a response has been returned.
