  summary: Get attestations rewards
  description: |
    Retrieve attestation reward info for validators specified by array of public keys or validator index.
    If no array is provided, return reward info for every validator.

    The `total_rewards` field MUST contain one entry for every validator selected by the request.
    The `ideal_rewards` field coverage is controlled by the `ideal_rewards` query parameter:
    - `none`: `ideal_rewards` MUST be omitted from the response.
    - `queried_validators`: `ideal_rewards` MUST contain one entry per distinct effective
      balance present in `total_rewards`.
    - `all`: `ideal_rewards` MUST contain one entry for every possible effective balance value for
      the target epoch and fork.

    If `ideal_rewards` is omitted:
    - when the request body is not provided, it defaults to `all`.
    - otherwise, it defaults to `queried_validators`.

    When `ideal_rewards` is present, entries MUST be sorted by increasing `effective_balance`.
