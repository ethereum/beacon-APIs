  summary: Get blobs
  description: |
    Retrieves blobs for a given block id.
    Depending on `Accept` header it can be returned either as json or as bytes serialized by SSZ.

    If the `indices` parameter is specified, only the blobs with the specified indices will be returned. There are no guarantees
    for the returned blobs in terms of ordering.

    After the Fulu fork, only supernodes (which custody all data columns) are required to return blobs. Clients may implement
    blob reconstruction logic for non-super nodes.
