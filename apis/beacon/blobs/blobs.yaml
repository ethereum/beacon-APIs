  summary: Get blobs
  description: |
    Retrieves blobs for a given block id.
    Depending on `Accept` header it can be returned either as json or as bytes serialized by SSZ.

    If the `versioned_hashes` parameter is specified, only the blobs for the specified versioned hashes will be returned. Blobs are 
    returned as an ordered list matching the order of their corresponding KZG commitments in the block.

    After the Fulu fork, only supernodes (which custody all data columns) are required to return blobs. Clients may implement
    blob reconstruction logic for non-super nodes.
