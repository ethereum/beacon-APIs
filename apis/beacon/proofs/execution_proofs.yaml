  summary: Get execution proofs
  description: |
    Retrieves execution proofs for a given block id.
    Depending on `Accept` header it can be returned either as JSON or as bytes serialized by SSZ.

    Proofs are returned as an ordered list of `ProverSignedExecutionProof` objects.

    Proofs are only available for recent blocks within the proof retention period.
